            <h2>Some Important Things to Know In Your 30s</h2>
            <p>
                Maintaining a healthy diet helps prevent overweight and obesity, especially for 30-year-olds, who often
                live a busy lifestyle. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 72 percent of U.S. men and 64
                percent of
                U.S. women are
                overweight or obese. A study published in a 2007 edition of the “Journal of the American Dietetic
                Association” found
                that college students who were more knowledgeable about nutrition guidelines had healthier eating
                patterns. Appropriate
                diets for 30-year-olds are based on gender, activity level and weight-management goals
            </p>

            <h2>Calories</h2>
            <p>
                The USDA provides calorie recommendations for all adults, including 30-year-olds. Based on these
                guidelines, men ages 19
                to 39 require 2,400 to 2,600 calories if they are sedentary, 2,600 to 2,800 calories if they are
                moderately active and
                about 3,000 calories per day if they are active or participate in physical activity equivalent to
                walking more than 3
                miles per day. The USDA also estimates that women ages 19 to 39 require 1,800 to 2,000 calories if they
                are sedentary,
                2,000 to 2,200 calories if they are moderately active and about 2,400 calories per day if they are
                active.

            </p>

            <h2>Weight loss</h2>
            <p>
                Overweight and obese 30-year-olds with a body mass index of 25 or above may consider a reduced-calorie
                diet for weight
                loss. BMI is a measurement calculated from weight and height and is a good indicator of body fat and
                chronic-disease
                risks. To calculate your BMI, multiply your weight in pounds by 703, divide by your height in inches and
                divide again by
                your height in inches; you can also use an online BMI calculator like the one provided by the National
                Heart, Lung and
                Blood Institute. To safely and effectively lose excess body weight, the Academy of Nutrition and
                Dietetics encourages an
                energy reduction of 500 to 1,00

            </p>


            <h2>Macronutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>
                A healthy diet for a 30-year-old consists of a good balance of carbohydrates, protein and fat. The
                Institute of Medicine
                recommends that adults ages 19 and older consume 45 to 65 percent of their calories from carbohydrates,
                10 to 35 percent
                from protein and 20 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat. The institute also encourages
                30-year-old men to
                consume at least 130 grams of carbohydrates and 56 grams of protein each day and 20-year-old women to
                consume at least
                130 grams of carbs and 46 grams of protein every day; pregnant and nursing women require at least 71
                grams of protein
                each day.

            </p>

            <h2>Sample 2,300-Calorie Plan
            </h2>
            <p>
                A 2,300-calorie diet is often appropriate for 30-year-old men who are moderately active and some
                large-framed sedentary
                30-year-old men. A healthy, sample USDA 2,600-calorie meal plans includes 3.5 cups of vegetables; 2 cups
                of fruits; 9
                ounces of grains; 3 cups of dairy foods; 6.5 ounces of protein foods such as lean meats, seafood, eggs
                and soy products;
                8 teaspoons of oils; and 362 additional calories each day.


            </p>


            <h2>Sample 1,800-Calorie Plan
            </h2>
            <p>
                A 1,800-calorie diet is usually appropriate for 30-year-old women who are sedentary to moderately
                active. A USDA sample
                1,800-calorie meal plan consists of 2.5 cups of vegetables; 2 cups of fruits; 6 ounces of grains; 3 cups
                of dairy foods;
                5.5 ounces of protein foods such as lean meats, seafood, eggs and soy products; 6 teaspoons of oils; and
                258 extra
                calories each day.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Folate</h2>
                <p class="center">It's critical for supporting a healthy pregnancy, preventing neural-tube defects and
                    helping your body make new cells.
                    Folate may also help reduce the risk of heart disease. Eat foods such as chickpeas, asparagus,
                    spinach, broccoli,
                    avocados, orange juice, and fortified whole grains to help meet your daily 400-microgram
                    requirement. </p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Phytonutrients</h2>
                <p class="center">"These compounds contain antioxidants, which slow the aging process, ward off heart
                    disease, and prevent changes in DNA,
                    potentially preventing the development of cancer," says Bonci. While phytonutrients come from
                    plants, dark chocolate,
                    red wine, and coffee are highest in them.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Iron</h2>
                <p class="center">When you don't get enough iron, you might feel physically drained and mentally
                    exhausted. Researchers at Penn State
                    University found that young women who were deficient in the mineral took longer and performed worse
                    on cognitive tasks
                    than those who had normal levels of iron. Get your daily dose of 18 milligrams from foods such as
                    clams, lean beef,
                    fortified breakfast cereal, soybeans, pumpkin seeds, and skinless poultry.

                Grabbing dinner on the go means you may be missing out on crucial nutrients, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, R.D.,
                a spokesperson
                for the American Dietetic Association. Slave over the stove? Nah. Choose healthy convenience foods such
                as rotisserie
                chicken, shrimp cocktail, steamed dumplings, and salads and enjoy them with speedy additions from your
                kitchen such as
                whole wheat pasta, instant brown rice, and frozen veggies. (If you're looking for a quick homemade meal,
                try meal

                Margaritas, mojitos, and cosmos can add up faster than you can say cheers. Enter light beer (110
                calories in a 12-ounce
                bottle). It's filling, so you're less likely to want a second, and it takes a good, long time to drink.

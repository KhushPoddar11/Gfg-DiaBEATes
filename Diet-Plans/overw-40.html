            <h2>Some Important Things to Know In Your 40s</h2>

            <h2>Understand that your body is changing — and that's okay.</h2>
            <p>
                As you age, your body begins to go through estrogen withdrawal, which may change the areas your body
                puts on weight. "In
                her childbearing years, a woman puts on weight in her butt, hips, and thighs to fuel breastfeeding,"
                says Pamela Peeke,
                M.D., author of Fit to Live. "The fat cells in those areas have estrogen receptors. As you go through
                estrogen
                withdrawal, those receptors aren't being activated anymore." (On the flip side, you could also
                experience estrogen
                dominance.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Maintaining a healthy diet helps prevent overweight and obesity, especially for 40-year-olds, who often
                live a buys
                lifestyle. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 72 percent of U.S. men and 64 percent of
                U.S. women are
                overweight or obese. A study published in a 2007 edition of the “Journal of the American Dietetic
                Association” found
                that college students who were more knowledgeable about nutrition guidelines had healthier eating
                patterns. Appropriate
                diets for 40-year-olds are based on gender, activity level and weight-management goals
            </p>

            <h2>Calories</h2>
            <p>
                The USDA provides calorie recommendations for all adults, including 40-year-olds. Based on these
                guidelines, men ages 19
                to 40 require 2,400 to 2,600 calories if they are sedentary, 2,600 to 2,800 calories if they are
                moderately active and
                about 3,000 calories per day if they are active or participate in physical activity equivalent to
                walking more than 3
                miles per day. The USDA also estimates that women ages 19 to 40 require 1,800 to 2,000 calories if they
                are sedentary,
                2,000 to 2,200 calories if they are moderately active and about 2,400 calories per day if they are
                active.

            </p>

            <h2>Weight loss</h2>
            <p>
                Overweight and obese 40-year-olds with a body mass index of 25 or above may consider a reduced-calorie
                diet for weight
                loss. BMI is a measurement calculated from weight and height and is a good indicator of body fat and
                chronic-disease
                risks. To calculate your BMI, multiply your weight in pounds by 703, divide by your height in inches and
                divide again by
                your height in inches; you can also use an online BMI calculator like the one provided by the National
                Heart, Lung and
                Blood Institute. To safely and effectively lose excess body weight, the Academy of Nutrition and
                Dietetics encourages an
                energy reduction of 500 to 1,00

            </p>


            <h2>Macronutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>
                A healthy diet for a 40-year-old consists of a good balance of carbohydrates, protein and fat. The
                Institute of Medicine
                recommends that adults ages 35 and older consume 45 to 65 percent of their calories from carbohydrates,
                10 to 35 percent
                from protein and 20 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat. The institute also encourages
                40-year-old men to
                consume at least 130 grams of carbohydrates and 56 grams of protein each day and 40-year-old women to
                consume at least
                130 grams of carbs and 46 grams of protein every day; pregnant and nursing women require at least 71
                grams of protein
                each day.

            </p>

            <h2>Sample 2,600-Calorie Plan
            </h2>
            <p>
                A 2,600-calorie diet is often appropriate for 40-year-old men who are moderately active and some
                large-framed sedentary
                40-year-old men. A healthy, sample USDA 2,600-calorie meal plans includes 3.5 cups of vegetables; 2 cups
                of fruits; 9
                ounces of grains; 3 cups of dairy foods; 6.5 ounces of protein foods such as lean meats, seafood, eggs
                and soy products;
                8 teaspoons of oils; and 362 additional calories each day.


            </p>


            <h2>Sample 2,000-Calorie Plan
            </h2>
            <p>
                A 2,000-calorie diet is usually appropriate for 40-year-old women who are sedentary to moderately
                active. A USDA sample
                2,000-calorie meal plan consists of 2.5 cups of vegetables; 2 cups of fruits; 6 ounces of grains; 3 cups
                of dairy foods;
                5.5 ounces of protein foods such as lean meats, seafood, eggs and soy products; 6 teaspoons of oils; and
                258 extra
                calories each day.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Calcium</h2>
                <p class="center">As you approach menopause, bone-building estrogen starts to decline and calcium
                    becomes more important. Ironically, you
                    absorb less calcium from the food you eat because your stomach doesn't make as much of the acid
                    necessary for
                    absorption. Aim for 1,000 milligrams a day from low-fat dairy, supplements, or a combination.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Vitamin D</h2>
                <p class="center">This nutrient helps your body absorb calcium, keeps your immune system strong,
                    protects against breast and colon
                    cancers, and even prevents hearing loss. But by the time you reach your 40s, your vitamin D levels
                    quickly start to
                    plummet. "There's no way to get enough vitamin D from your diet because very few foods contain it,"
                    says Bonci. Your
                    best bet: a daily supplement of 600 to 1,000 international units. (The FDA regulates supplements
                    like food rather than
                    drugs, i.e. less strictly. If you're thinking of taking a supplement, always check with your doctor
                    first.)

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Fiber</h2>
                <p class="center">Fiber not only makes you feel fuller longer, but it also "helps decrease cholesterol
                    and your risk for colon cancer,"
                    says Dr. Peeke. Try to eat a mix of soluble (from fruits, vegetables, barley, and oats) and
                    insoluble (from whole-wheat
                    bread and bran) fiber daily.

            </h2>
            <p>
                "For every decade after 40, there's roughly a one percent decrease in calorie requirements," says Bonci.
                "That's the
                equivalent of one extra cookie." (It's also important not to deprive yourself, so you should always meet
                with a
                dietitian to get personal caloric recommendations, and if you want the cookie, go for it.)

                Grabbing dinner on the go means you may be missing out on crucial nutrients, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, R.D.,
                a spokesperson
                for the American Dietetic Association. Slave over the stove? Nah. Choose healthy convenience foods such
                as rotisserie
                chicken, shrimp cocktail, steamed dumplings, and salads and enjoy them with speedy additions from your
                kitchen such as
                whole wheat pasta, instant brown rice, and frozen veggies. (If you're looking for a quick homemade meal,
                try meal
                prepping.)

            <h2>Drink to your health
            </h2>
            <p>
                Margaritas, mojitos, and cosmos can add up faster than you can say cheers. Enter light beer (110
                calories in a 12-ounce
                bottle). It's filling, so you're less likely to want a second, and it takes a good, long time to drink.

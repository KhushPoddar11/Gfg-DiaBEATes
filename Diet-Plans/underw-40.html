            <h2>Some Important Things to Know In Your 40s</h2>
            <p>
                Just like obesity causes health concerns, having less weight than the normal also poses health issues.
                Being underweight
                can be result of poor nutrition and should be a matter of concern. If the body does not receive adequate
                amounts of
                nutrients, the body fails to function to its utmost. This could result in the imbalance in the
                metabolism. Inculcating a
                healthy diet for underweight will provide the necessary nutrients for better functioning of the body.
            </p>

            <h2>How to deal with underweight</h2>
            <p>
                To deal with underweight, maintaining a proper nutritious diet is important. We create a weight gain
                meal plan for
                underweight, easily followed by both males and females. We try to add food with high-calorie foods for
                underweight
                adults. This diet meal plan is used to provide the right nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required by
                the body. You can
                easily buy food items listed in the underweight diet meal plan in your local markets.

            </p>

            <h2>What to avoid</h2>
            <p>
                We also list those food items that should be avoided while following the underweight meal plan. While
                following this
                Indian diet meal plan, also follow these lifestyle changes and habits. We also listed out meal timing
                and what food
                items you need to eat to gain weight. These healthy meals are listed after discussion with professional
                dietitians.

            </p>


            <h2>Macronutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>
                A healthy diet for a 40-year-old consists of a good balance of carbohydrates, protein and fat. The
                Institute of Medicine
                recommends that adults ages 19 and older consume 45 to 65 percent of their calories from carbohydrates,
                10 to 35 percent
                from protein and 20 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat. The institute also encourages
                40-year-old men to
                consume at least 130 grams of carbohydrates and 56 grams of protein each day and 40-year-old women to
                consume at least
                130 grams of carbs and 46 grams of protein every day; pregnant and nursing women require at least 71
                grams of protein
                each day.

            <div class="box">

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Calcium</h2>
                <p class="center">Calcium</h2>
                <p class="center">As you approach menopause, bone-building estrogen starts to decline and calcium
                    becomes more important. Ironically, you
                    absorb less calcium from the food you eat because your stomach doesn't make as much of the acid
                    necessary for
                    absorption. Aim for 1,000 milligrams a day from low-fat dairy, supplements, or a combination. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Vitamin D</h2>
                <p class="center">This nutrient helps your body absorb calcium, keeps your immune system strong,
                    protects against breast and colon
                    cancers, and even prevents hearing loss. But by the time you reach your 40s, your vitamin D levels
                    quickly start to
                    plummet. "There's no way to get enough vitamin D from your diet because very few foods contain it,"
                    says Bonci. Your
                    best bet: a daily supplement of 600 to 1,000 international units. (The FDA regulates supplements
                    like food rather than
                    drugs, i.e. less strictly. If you're thinking of taking a supplement, always check with your doctor
                    first.)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Fiber</h2>
                <p class="center">Fiber not only makes you feel fuller longer, but it also "helps decrease cholesterol
                    and your risk for colon cancer,"
                    says Dr. Peeke. Try to eat a mix of soluble (from fruits, vegetables, barley, and oats) and
                    insoluble (from whole-wheat
                    bread and bran) fiber daily.

            <h2>Food Items You Can Easily Consume in Underweight Diet Plan

            </h2>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lean Red Meat: Steak contains a ton of protein and iron. Red meat is high in cholesterol, so most
                    food professionals
                    don’t recommend it as part of a healthy diet more than a few times per week.
                </li>

                <li>Real Nut Butters: Natural peanut butter is packed with protein and fats, making it a great choice
                    for people trying to
                    gain weight the healthy way. One tablespoon contains around 100 calories and has 4 grams of protein.
                </li>

                <li>Whole Fat Milk: Dietitians say that one simple substitution you can make when trying to gain weight
                    is swapping your
                    skim milk for whole milk. It’s only 60 calories more a glass as the fat is left in.
                </li>
                <li>Tropical Fruit: Fruits like mango, papaya, bananas, and pineapple are amazing choices according to
                    food experts. They
                    are full of natural sugars and can give you great energy.</li>
                <li>Avocado: These delicious green vegetables are an excellent way to add heart-healthy fats to your
                    diet. One half of an
                    avocado contains 140 calories, but also contain high levels of potassium, folic acid, and vitamin E.
                </li>
                <li>Natural Granola: Natural granola with no added refined sugar is a great cereal to enjoy if you are
                    trying to gain
                    weight. This tasty snack is made from rolled oats, sugar, and healthy fats (like nuts and coconut
                    oil). More dried fruit
                    and nuts can also be added.
                </li>
                <li>Whole Wheat Bread: Nutritionists say that eating healthy bread products is a great way to start
                    gaining weight. If
                    you’re adding bread to your diet, look for whole grains. Nuts: Nuts are a great snack for gaining
                    weight. They are full
                    of fat and nutrients, but also contain a great deal of fiber. Eating only a handful of nuts can keep
                    you full for hours.
                    Not all nuts are equal for fiber though.
                </li>
                <li>Cheese: Try goat cheese with eggs, Swiss with roasted chicken, and Parmesan on top of asparagus. On
                    its own, cheese also
                    makes a great snack because it’s high in protein.</li>

            <h2>Make fast food healthy
            </h2>
            <p>
                Grabbing dinner on the go means you may be missing out on crucial nutrients, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, R.D.,
                a spokesperson
                for the American Dietetic Association. Slave over the stove? Nah. Choose healthy convenience foods such
                as rotisserie
                chicken, shrimp cocktail, steamed dumplings, and salads and enjoy them with speedy additions from your
                kitchen such as
                whole wheat pasta, instant brown rice, and frozen veggies. (If you're looking for a quick homemade meal,
                try meal
                prepping.)

            <h2>Drink to your health
            </h2>
            <p>
                Margaritas, mojitos, and cosmos can add up faster than you can say cheers. Enter light beer (110
                calories in a 12-ounce
                bottle). It's filling, so you're less likely to want a second, and it takes a good, long time to drink.
